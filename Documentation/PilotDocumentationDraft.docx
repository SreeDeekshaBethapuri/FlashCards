Flashcards cz WHY PAY FOR THEM
Version 1 – Documentation
Pilot Production Requirements Document

Purpose
This document serves as the official reference for Version 1 of the Flashcards web application. It captures what was built for the MVP, how it works, and where we’re headed next. Any future updates, features, or redesigns will stack on top of this base.

Concept
We want a free, joyful, minimal, open-source flashcards app. Users should be able to store knowledge (keywords and their definitions) and use interactive flashcards to revise and self-test. No signups. No fees. Just vibes and revision.

Primary User Story (MVP)
As a user who wants to study better,
I want a cute, clear interface
So that I can create flashcards and use them for revision.

Core Features (v1)
Page	Functionality
Welcome Page	Friendly greeting, aesthetic gif, and navigation buttons
Entry Page	Add a flashcard via a simple form (keyword + definition)
Practice Page	View one random flashcard at a time, flip to reveal the answer, go to next
All pages are linked via navigation buttons and share a consistent, Bootstrap-styled layout.
